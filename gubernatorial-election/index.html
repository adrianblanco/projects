        <p class="body-text sub-font">Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York, is likely to be reelected for another term on November 6. He is ahead in the polls by a large margin against the Republican candidate Marc Molinaro. He managed the campaign with a steady pulse beating the actress and activist Cynthia Nixon and her main claim in favor of affordable housing in New York. And, now, his allegedly connections with real estate companies are no more in the public gaze.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p class="body-text sub-font">On average, four out of five of the candidates who spend the most money for their campaigns usually win. This is another positive sign for Cuomo, whose campaign has been financially backed with millions of dollars from private companies. When running for an election, it is clear that money makes the difference, yet it also determines the direction of future policies. For the 2018 Gubernatorial election, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo has raised by far the most money from real estate businesses.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">Cuomo is not the only candidate behind the interest of real estate companies. Phil Scott, Governor of Vermont, Kay Ellen Ivey, Governor of Alabama and Christopher Sununu, Governor of New Hampshire, have raised at least 10% of their campaign funds from real estate companies. All the candidates are likely to be re-elected on November 6 and each of these states is friendly to the real estate industry.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">In total, real estate has spent more than 563 million for the 2018 Gubernatorial races, according to an analysis of data from Follow the money. Real estate businesses have been careful enough to back the candidates who are most likely to be re-elected.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">Real estate businesses are often affected much more by state laws compared with other businesses. As a result, Governors, responsible for implementing state laws, are one of their main targets. Cuomo was also on top of real estate contributions in the previous elections he ran for in 2014 and 2010.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">During the democratic primaries, Cuomo raised more than one million dollars from the industry to beat his opposing candidate, Cynthia Nixon, who placed affordable housing near the center of her campaign. Nixon also rejected contributions from the real estate companies that funded Cuomo.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">Yet, Cuomo is not the only candidate of interest to real estate companies. Phil Scott, Governor of Vermont, Kay Ellen Ivey, Governor of Alabama and Christopher Sununu, Governor of New Hampshire, have raised at least 10% of their campaign funds from real estate companies. All the candidates are likely to be re-elected on November 6, with their respective states known to be friendly to the real estate industry.</p>
    
      <p class="body-text sub-font">In total, real estate has spent more than 57 million for the 2018 Gubernatorial races, according to an analysis of data from ‚ÄòFollow the money‚Äô. With 77% of the available documents collected and processed, Cuomo has received 8% of those funds, which equates to 4.6 millions dollars. Real estate businesses have been careful enough to back the Governor candidates who are most likely to be re-elected.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">The Real Estate Board of New York is the trade association that lobbies on behalf of the real estate industry in the city. When they were asked about why there are such large differences in contributions depending on the type of the election and the candidate, they did not provide an answer by the time this article was published. </p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">In 2018, more than seventy  Gubernatorial candidates received funds from a real estate company. Compared to other elections, it is clear that Gubernatorial races are by far the most appealing for real estate companies. For the midterm elections, they have spent 21 million dollars, a third of the total amount invested in the Gubernatorial election.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">The interest of real estate in general elections is also not as high as in Gubernatorial elections. In 2016, real estate companies spent 40 million dollars, with Hillary Clinton as the candidate who received the most money from the companies. </p>
