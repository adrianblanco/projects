This is another positive sign for <span class="dem">Cuomo</span>, whose campaign has been financially backed with millions of dollars from private companies ‚Äì $57 million so far in this election cycle. And when running for an election, it is clear that money makes the difference, yet it also determines the direction of future policies. For the 2018 Gubernatorial election, Governor <span class="dem">Andrew M. Cuomo</span> has raised by far the most money from real estate businesses ‚Äì $4,6 million so far.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font"><span class="dem">Cuomo</span> is not the only gubernatorial candidate beholden to the real estate industry. <span class="rep">Phil Scott</span>, governor of Vermont; <span class="rep">Kay Ellen Ivey</span>, governor of Alabama; and <span class="rep">Christopher Sununu</span>, Governor of New Hampshire, have raised at least 10% of their campaign funds from real estate companies. All these candidates are likely to be re-elected on November 6,  and each of these states is friendly to the real estate industry.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">In total, real estate has spent more than $563 million for the 2018 Gubernatorial races, according to an analysis of data from Follow the Money. Real estate businesses have been careful enough to back the candidates who are most likely to be re-elected.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">Real estate businesses are often affected much more by state laws compared with other businesses. As a result, governors, responsible for implementing state laws, are one of their main targets. <span class="dem">Cuomo</span> was also on top of real estate contributions in his previous elections--in 2014 and 2010.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">During the Democratic primaries, <span class="dem">Cuomo</span> raised more than one million dollars from the industry to beat his opposing candidate, <span class="dem">Cynthia Nixon</span>, who placed affordable housing near the center of her campaign. Nixon also rejected contributions from the real estate companies that funded <span class="dem">Cuomo</span>. She challenged him to follow suit, but he did not.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">In total, real estate has spent more than $57 million for the 2018 Gubernatorial races. With 77% of the available campaign contribution documents collected and processed, <span class="dem">Cuomo</span> has received 8% of those funds, which equates to $4.6 million. </p>
    
      <p class="body-text sub-font">The Real Estate Board of New York is the trade association that lobbies on behalf of the real estate industry in the city. When they were asked about why there are such large differences in contributions depending on the type of the election and the candidate, they did not provide an answer by the time this article was published.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">In 2018, more than seventy gubernatorial candidates received funds from a real estate company. Compared to other elections, it is clear that gubernatorial races are by far the most appealing for real estate companies. For the midterm elections overall, they have spent $21 million dollars. For the nationwide gubernatorial races, they have spent three times as much. In the 2016 presidential race, real estate companies spent $40 million dollars overall, with <span class="dem">Hillary Clinton</span> as the candidate who received the most money from the companies.</p>
