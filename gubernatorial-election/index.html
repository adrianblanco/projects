        <p class="body-text sub-font">Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York, is likely to be reelected for another term on November 6. He is ahead in the polls by a large margin against the Republican candidate Marc Molinaro. He managed the campaign with a steady pulse beating the actress and activist Cynthia Nixon and her main claim in favor of affordable housing in New York. And, now, his allegedly connections with real estate companies are no more in the public gaze.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p class="body-text sub-font">On average, four out of five of the candidates who spend the most money usually wins. Another positive signal for Cuomo whose campaign has been financially backed with millions of dollars from private companies. When running for an election, money makes the difference. But also can determine the direction of the future policies. For the 2018 Gubernatorial election, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, is the candidate who has raised by far more money from real estate business.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">Cuomo is not the only candidate behind the interest of real estate companies. Phil Scott, Governor of Vermont, Kay Ellen Ivey, Governor of Alabama and Christopher Sununu, Governor of New Hampshire, have raised at least 10% of their campaign funds from real estate companies. All the candidates are likely to be re-elected on November 6 and each of these states is friendly to the real estate industry.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">In total, real estate has spent more than 563 million for the 2018 Gubernatorial races, according to an analysis of data from Follow the money. Real estate businesses have been careful enough to back the candidates who are most likely to be re-elected.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">Real estate businesses are affected more by state laws than other businesses. As a result, Governors, responsible for implementing state laws, are one of their main targets. In 2018, more than seventy  Gubernatorial candidates received funds from a real estate company.</p>

      <p class="body-text sub-font">Cuomo raised $35 million dollars from the industry to beat the other democrat candidate for the Democratic primaries, Cynthia Nixon, the actor and activist who placed affordable housing near the center of her campaign. She also rejected contributions from the real estate shell companies that funded her opponent.</p>
